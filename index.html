                        Our core Java programming tutorial is designed for students and working professionals.
                         Java is an object-oriented, class-based,
                         concurrent, secured and general-purpose computer-programming language. 
                        It is a widely used robust technology.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust,
                         object-oriented and secure programming language.
                        Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. 
                        James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java,
                         its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, 
                        so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.

                            Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs,
                             is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API,
                              it is called a platform.

                    <p>According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java.
                         There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:<br></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.</li>
                        <li> Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.</li>
                        <li>Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.</li>

                    <p>
                        There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:
                    </p>
                   <ol>
                    <li> <b>Standalone Application:</b></li>
                      Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications.
                      These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine.
                      Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc.
                      AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.

                    <li><b> Web Application:</b></li>
                        An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. 
                        Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. 
                        technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.

                    <li><b> Enterprise Application:</b></li>
                         An application that is distributed in nature, 
                         such as banking applications, etc. is called an enterprise application.
                          It has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering.
                           In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.

                    <li><b> Mobile Application:</b></li>
                         An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application.
                          Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.

                <header>Java OOPs Concepts</header>
                <article>
                 <p>In this page, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. 
                    Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts, 
                    such as <b>inheritance, data binding, polymorphism,</b> etc.

                    <b>Simula</b> is considered the first object-oriented programming language.
                    The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language.

                    <b>Smalltalk</b> is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.

                     he popular object-oriented languages are Java, C#, PHP, Python, C++, etc.
                     The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities,
                      for example, object, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
                     
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    <b>Object</b>means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc.
                    Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
                     It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:
                 </p>
                 <ul>
                    <li> Object</li>
                    <li> Class</li>
                     <li> Inheritance</li>
                      <li>Polymorphism</li>
                        <li>Abstraction</li>
                        <li>Encapsulation</li>

                    <p>If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as <b>Method Overloading</b>.

                        If we have to perform only one operation, having same name of the methods increases the readability of the program.
                        
                        Suppose you have to perform addition of the given numbers but there can be any number of arguments, if you write the method such as a(int,int) for two parameters, and b(int,int,int) for three parameters then it may be difficult for you as well as other programmers to understand the behavior of the method because its name differs.
                        
                        So, we perform method overloading to figure out the program quickly.</p>
                    <p><h4>Advantage of method overloading</h4>
                        Method overloading increases the readability of the program.
                        
                        Different ways to overload the method
                        There are two ways to overload the method in java
                        <ol>
                          <li>  By changing number of arguments</li>
                          <li> By changing the data type</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                  <p>  <b>Method Overloading: changing no. of arguments</b>
                        In this example, we have created two methods,
                         first add() method performs addition of two numbers and second add method performs addition of three numbers.
                        In this example, we are creating static methods so that we don't need to create instance for calling methods.
                    </p>

                    <code>class Adder{  
                        static int add(int a,int b){return a+b;}  
                        static int add(int a,int b,int c){return a+b+c;}  
                        }  
                        class TestOverloading1{  
                        public static void main(String[] args){  
                        System.out.println(Adder.add(11,11));  
                        System.out.println(Adder.add(11,11,11));  
                        }}<br>  </code>
                    <p> <b>Method Overloading: changing data type of arguments</b>
                        In this example, we have created two methods that differs in data type. 
                        The first add method receives two integer arguments and second add method receives two double arguments.</p>
                        
                  <code>class Adder{  
                        static int add(int a, int b){return a+b;}  
                        static double add(double a, double b){return a+b;}  
                        }  
                        class TestOverloading2{  
                        public static void main(String[] args){  
                        System.out.println(Adder.add(11,11));  
                        System.out.println(Adder.add(12.3,12.6));

                        A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java. 
                        It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).

                        Before learning the Java abstract class, let's understand the abstraction in Java first.

                    <p>
                        JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; 
                        rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function 
                        (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code 
                        will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which 
                        x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
                    </p>
                    <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } <br>console.log(x); // 5</code>
                    <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                    <code>
                        if (true) { let y = 5; } <br>console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
                        not defined

                <header>Constructors in Java</header>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. 
                        It is called when an instance of the class is created.
                         At the time of calling constructor,
                         memory for the object is allocated in the memory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.

                        Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
                        
                        It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class. In such case,
                         Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.
                    </p>
                  <h4> Rules for creating Java constructor</h4>
                  <ul>
                     <li>There are two rules defined for the constructor.</li>
                     <li>Constructor name must be the same as its class name</li>
                     <li>A Constructor must have no explicit return type</li>
                     <li>A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized</li>
